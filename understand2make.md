## College Connect

### Our Team
[Dylan Martin](https://dylan-martin.github.io/) | [Wei Luo](https://wl5.github.io/) | [Julian Vera](https://verajulian.github.io/)

We chose not to assign specific group roles to our members because of the dynamic nature of our project and the varied tasks required to complete it.  Instead, we divided work for each task based on our group member's particular skills and availability.

### Problem and Solution Overview

College Connect was inspired by a simple observation: learning about colleges is hard.  For many applicants, commonly available resources, such as college admissions offices and campus tours, do not provide the type of in-depth information about campus culture and activities that are often most helpful when searching for and selecting a college.  Through College Connect, an app connecting college applicants to students at the schools they are interested in, we hope to make this information available to everyone on a comfortable and reliable platform.  Our app allows applicants to share personal information and interests, and suggests students at their prospective colleges who share these interests.  We hope to facilitate personal conversations between users to help spread genuine and useful information for the college search process.  Read our [project proposal](/grpproposal.md) to learn more.

### Initial Paper Prototype

See our initial paper prototype [here](/paper_proto.md).  We began our process of iterative design with this prototype. Substantially smaller than later iterations, this initial version provided a basis from which we could expand our functionality and design to match user needs.

### Testing Process

We conducted four usability tests with our paper prototype, updating and expanding the prototype several times during this process.  For a discussion of our process for the first three of these tests, see our [Usability Testing Check-In](/ut_checkin.md) (particularly the "Usability Testing" section).  For a discussion of our final test, see our [Usability Testing Review](/ut_review.md) (particularly the "Participants" and "Analysis" sections).

### Testing Results

We changed our paper prototype at several stages throughout the testing process.  To see changes made following a heurisitic analysis and design critique of our initial paper prototype, see the "Updates from Heuristic Analysis and Peer Review" section of our [Usability Testing Check-In](/ut_checkin.md).  To see updates made after our first three usability tests, see the "Results from Usability Tests" section of our [Usability Testing Check-In](/ut_checkin.md).  Finally, to see the results of our final usability test, see the "Critical Issues" and "Important Revisions" sections of our [Usability Testing Review](/ut_review.md).

### Final Paper Prototype

See our final paper prototype in the "Current Paper Prototype" section of our [Usability Testing Review](/ut_review.md).  This final iteration on our prototype was the product of the iterative design process documented above and the implementation of our testing results in the form of a paper prototype.

### Digital Mockup

See our digital mockup [here](/digital_mockup.md).  Our mockup was largely a translation of our paper prototype into the Balsamiq mockup platform.  We incorporated some aesthetic changes to our paper prototype to better model a fully implemented platform in our mockup, and have modified the mockup to match feedback recieved in class.
