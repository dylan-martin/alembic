We chose not to assign specific group roles to our members because of the dynamic nature of our project and the varied tasks required to complete it.  Instead, we divided work for each task based on our group member's particular skills and availability.

## Problem and Solution Overview

College Connect was inspired by a simple observation: learning about colleges is hard.  For many applicants, commonly available resources, such as college admissions offices and campus tours, do not provide the type of in-depth information about campus culture and activities that are often most helpful when searching for and selecting a college.  Through College Connect, an app connecting college applicants to students at the schools they are interested in, we hope to make this information available to everyone on a comfortable and reliable platform.  Our app allows applicants to share personal information and interests, and suggests students at their prospective colleges who share these interests.  We hope to facilitate personal conversations between users to help spread genuine and useful information for the college search process.  Read our project proposal, linked below, to learn more.

## Design Research

Our research consisted of three contextual inquries with individuals representing various stakeholders in our project: a current college student speaking with younger relatives about the college search process and his experiences at Williams, a high school junior currently in the process of searching for a college, and a Williams College admissions officer presenting at an information session.  To learn more about why we chose these participants and the stakeholders in this project, see our [Contextual Inquiry Plan](/ciplan.md).  For an in-depth analysis of these inquiries and our analysis of them, see our [Contextual Inquiry Review](/cireview.md).
