### 1) Find other users who have/participate in similar interests to you.
Sally, a current high school senior, logs on to College Connect to learn more about the schools that she is applying to.  She lives on the west coast, but is interested in attending Williams College.  Because of the distance, she will not be able to visit Williams, and does not know any current students at the college.  However, after listing her personal information and passion for playing the oboe on the platform, she is able to see several Williams students who have overlapping interests and backgrounds.  Sally is able to connect with George, a Williams student who attended a nearby high school, and Gaby, who participates in the wind ensamble at Williams.  Through converstations with these students, Sally is able to learn more about the experience of students at Williams with whom she shares background and interests and get an honest representation of life at Williams.

### 2) Speak candidly without fear of repurcussion from colleges.
John is a current high school senior applying to Williams College.  He recently connected with Timmy, a current senior at Williams on College Connect.  While John is excited at the possibility of attending Williams, he was nervous about rumors that he had heard about the academic culture on campus, but does not feel comfortable bringing these concerns up with an admissions officer for fear of hurting his applicant.  Because Timmy, as a student user of College Connect, is not affiliated with the admissions office, John is able to direct his questions to Timmy candidly.  Additionally, because Timmy does not have any obligation to encourage John to attend Williams, he is able and willing to provide honest, genuine answers about his own experience at the college.  Through this exchange, John gets honest responses to his questions from an experienced source.
