### Decisions and Changes

We kept our digital mock-up much the same as our final paper prototype.  We chose to use Balsamiq to make our mock-up, as we believe that the "wire-frame" style of the program will help us to continue recieving feedback on our design as a work in progress and communicate to test participants that we are still in a phase of design where we are testing functionality rather than aesthetics.  We found that the screens developed for the paper prototype throughout the usability testing process effectively covered the functionality that we hoped to provide in our prototype.  Additionally,   We made a few cosmetic changes to the paper prototype in the process of adapting it into a digital mock-up:

* Some buttons were changed into icons (e.g. the help button on the screens where the user is creating their profile is now represented by a "?" icon).
* Some basic changes were made to the layout of the screens to make them better fit the Balsamiq templates (e.g. moving the "add club" and "add sport" options next to their respective search catagories on the potential connections search page).
