## Mock-Up

![Overview](/img/mockup_overview.png)

## Decisions and Changes

We kept our digital mock-up much the same as our final paper prototype.  We chose to use Balsamiq to make our mock-up, as we believe that the "wire-frame" style of the program will help us to continue receiving feedback on our design as a work in progress and communicate to test participants that we are still in a phase of design where we are testing functionality rather than aesthetics.  We found that the screens developed for the paper prototype throughout the usability testing process effectively covered the functionality that we hoped to provide in our prototype.  Additionally,   We made a few cosmetic changes to the paper prototype in the process of adapting it into a digital mock-up:

* Some buttons were changed into icons (e.g. the help button on the screens where the user is creating their profile is now represented by a "?" icon).
* Some basic changes were made to the layout of the screens to make them better fit the Balsamiq templates (e.g. moving the "add club" and "add sport" options next to their respective search catagories on the potential connections search page).

## Overview

### Share Personal Information

Upon first opening the College Connect app, users are presented with a simple welcome screen.

If the user has already created a College Connect profile, they will log in and be directed to their "Conversations" page:

If this is a new user, they will select "New User" and will be directed to a screen allowing them to designate a username and a password:

After the user presses "done", they are redirected to a page that lets them choose their user type.

After the user selects the appropriate type, they will be directed to their personal profile screen, where they can share basic information about themselves.  The screen will be slightly different for current college students (left) and applicants (right)  This information includes their name, school (college students) or prospective schools (college applicants), class year, home town, interests, and a short personal bio.

After they complete their profile and press the "done" button, they will be directed to this screen, which will guide them to the potential connections page.

### Find Users with Similar Interests

Once the user has input their interests, they will see a list of either college or applicant students with similar interests. They can then select someone to learn more about them and other shared information.

After they have selected a student, they can decide to initiate a conversation and/or learn more about others using the back button.

The user can press the “conversation” tab to navigate to the conversation interface. This interface shows the user’s conversations with other users, ordered by recent messages. The user can press the tab with the person’s name to begin chatting with that person.

This interface allows the user to chat with another user. At the top-left corner, the back arrow takes the user back to the previous page. The name of the person with whom the user is chatting is displayed at the top. At the top-right corner are options for audio call and video call.  Messages are shown in the main body of the interface, with the other person’s messages on the right. At the bottom, the user can enter a message and press “send” to send.
