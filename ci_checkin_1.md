## Describe your first inquiry:
(Who did you observe or interview? their background, and the environment.  REMEMBER: All names of inquiry participants should be replaced with pseudonyms in all documents you submit to me! It is important to protect the identity of your participants even in the case that your study seems harmless.)


## What did you learn?


## What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?



## Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?




## Plan for Future Inquiries:
For our next two inquiries, we plan to contact the Williams College admission office and schedule a time when we can participate in information sessions and observe/interview participants.  For admission officers, we will schedule an appointment after an information session. For prospective students and their parents, we will ask them ahead of time if we could observe them during the information session and interview after.  Then, during the information session, we will take note of what aspects of the college the students are most interested in.  After the information session, we will interview students/parents and admission officers separately.  We will bring plenty of post-it notes, so that we take notes and gather them into an affinity diagram later.  Then using the affinity diagram, we can find out what common elements college are viewed as crucial across all participant, and thus come up specific features to suit our users.  We will also reflect on our next two inquiries in the next assignment we turn in.  We've found the schedule for information sessions, so our next two inquiries will be Tuesday, Februrary 27th at 1:45 pm and Wednesday, Februrary 28th at 1:45 pm.

## How do you plan to change your protocol based on what you learned in your first inquiry?
