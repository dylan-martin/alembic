He has spoken with personal aquiantences about the college search process and his experience in college throughout his Williams career.

* Randy: A current senior at Williams College studying English and economics.  Randy plays Ultimate Frisbee at Williams and is involved in an investment club on campus.  He has spoken to college applicants from his hometown on several occassions to discuss the college search process and has spoken to prospective students considering playing frisbee on campus.

* Alex: A current senior at Williams College studying economics.  Alex plays Ultimate Frisbee at Williams.  He is relatively unexperienced in speaking to prospective students about his college experience.

* Jane: A current high school senior from Massachusetts who was recently admitted to several colleges and is currently deciding where she will attend school.  She is involved in Mock Trial, speech and debate, and plays Volleyball in school.  She is considering pursuing all of these interests in college.

### Analysis

For a full analysis of the first three participants and the revisions made to our paper prototype following these tests, see our [Usability Test Check In](/ut_checkin.md).

Unfortuantely, due to inclement weather, we were not able to conduct our usability test with Jane in person.  Instead, we conducted the test remotely using digital images of our paper prototype and a screen-sharing platform.  While this was different than other usability tests, we felt that we were able to gain valuable information from the test and have the participant interact with the interface effectively.  In the test, Dylan acted as facilitator, Wei as observer, and Julian as computer (he selected the appropriate image to share based on the participant's stated actions).  Because the screen-sharing platform required that Jane speak aloud the interactions that she had with the platform, we found that the participant was more encouraged to think out loud during the process than in previous tests.  This resulted in more continuous feedback throughout testing.

Because we conducted the test remotely, we were not able to fully control the environment in which Jane completed the test.  She told us that she was in a common space in her home, which we feel effectively reflects a common experience that an applicant user would have with our platform.  After completing the testing process, we asked Jane for any concluding thoughts she had on the platform and any remaining questions that she had for us.

### Critical Issues

Jane identified three key issues with our current paper prototype.

1) While we present a log in option in the opening screen, we did not support its functionality.  To resolve this, we added a screen, which comes before a new users is prompted to select their user type, which allows them to create a username and password for future access.  Additionally, we added a log in screen which will direct users to their current conversations page upon the entry of their previously set username and password.

2) Jane was concerned with privacy on the app.  As it is currently designed, any potential connection is able to send a message to other users and initiate conversations via text, audio, or video (audio and video require the other user to accept the call).

3) Users should be better able to search for people with particular attributes in their potential connections. WRITE SOLUTION WRITE SOLUTION WRITE SOLUTION WRITE SOLUTION WRITE SOLUTION.
