## Tasks


### 3) Sharing Basic Information with Other Users – Easy Task
Hopper is a shy high school student from LA looking for current college students to discuss college experiences in general.  She prefers communicating with freshman college girls.  Also, she hopes to find students attending school near LA so that they have the possibility of meeting up.  Because of her shyness, Hopper values privacy highly.  She does not want everyone in the world to see the information she shares.  She is comfortable sharing with others her personal information such as photos and hometown only after they have been introduced to each other.  She wants to be able to share basic information to help her get to know others easily.  She also wants control of the content she shares.

4) College Ranking – Hard Task
Turing is a high school student from California looking for colleges. He loves warm weather, enjoys climbing mountains and detests snow. He likes large cities. He is into computer science and is also looking into playing football in college. He knows that he has strong academics, so he has a general feeling of what tier of schools are good fits for him. However, as there are still too many schools to consider, Turing needs help with picking out a set of schools that will allow him to continue his interests in college. Within this set, Turing is interested in knowing which ones fit him the best, so that it is easier to make the right choices. Turing wants a ranked list of schools that take his interests into account.
