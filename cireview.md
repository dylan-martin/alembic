SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

## Participants

We  conducted three contextual inquiries with the key stakeholders in the college search process.  First, we observed a conversation between Vinny, a senior at Williams, and his cousin who is currently applying to Williams.  This inquiry importantly reminded us to pay attention to our college-aged users and ensure that we are serving the needs od this user segment.  Additionally, observing Vinny's conversation with his younger cousin made evident the importance of creating a platform that encourages casual and honest discourse between users.  

These user needs were further emphasized while observing Sam, a high school senior and potential lacrosse recruit from Vermont, at an admissions office information session.  During the session, Sam primarily expressed interest in the school's academics and resources.  However, when we discussed his college search process, Sam expressed that he valued information from other students more highly than from school administrators.  He said that, especially when speaking with potential teammates, he was able to get the "real feel" for the school and campus life.  He seemed particularly concerned with interpersonal relationships on campus, and relied on students he met to learn about how people in particular social groups interact and what they are involved in on campus.

## Themes and Process

Our inquiries produced serveral key themes about user needs and design requirements.  We identified these themes through a progressive process of affinity diagramming.  We first created a diagram using notes taken from our inquiry with Vinny.  As we completed our other inquiries, we compared the notes taken from them to this initial diagram.  While each of these inquiries addressed a different user segment, the diagramming process yeilded significant overlap in their needs.  First,
