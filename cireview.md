title: Contextual Inquiry Review
layout: page
---

In our contextual inquiry process, we had the opportunity to learn about three of our key stakeholders--college applicants, college students, and admissions officers.  Each of these user segments will use College Connect in fundamentally different ways and to accomplish differing tasks.  However, across our inquiries, we observed three key common user requirements: 1) a comfortable and casual environment for conversations 2) a trustworthy source of information that is not biased by interest in the college and 3) a shared interest from all users in our platform being a useful and robust source for college information.

## Participants

We conducted three contextual inquiries with the key stakeholders in the college search process.  First, we observed a conversation between Vinny, a senior at Williams, and his cousin who is currently applying to Williams.  This inquiry importantly reminded us to pay attention to our college-aged users and ensure that we are serving the needs of this user segment.  Additionally, observing Vinny's conversation with his younger cousin made evident the importance of creating a platform that encourages casual and honest discourse between users.  

These user needs were further emphasized while observing Sam, a high school senior and potential lacrosse recruit from Vermont, at an admissions office information session.  During the session, Sam primarily expressed interest in the school's academics and resources.  However, when we discussed his college search process, Sam expressed that he valued information from other students more highly than from school administrators.  He said that, especially when speaking with potential teammates, he was able to get the "real feel" for the school and campus life.  He seemed particularly concerned with interpersonal relationships on campus, and relied on students he met to learn about how people in particular social groups interact and what they are involved in on campus.  

Another perspective came from Alice, an admission counselor at Williams.  We observed an information session directed by her, and communicated with her via a semi-structured interview.  During the session, Alice primarily described the college's specialties and what the admissions look for in prospective students.  For specialties, Alice highlighted the fact that Williams has quite strong academics, and creates an intimate learning environment with its responsive faculty and small class sizes. She said that admissions generally look for what makes an individual unique.  She urged students to express their interests by writing about them in the application essays.  She also encouraged students who are into arts to submit an arts portfolio.  During the interview, Alice mentioned that while the admissions gave an outline of the college's statistics, perspective students should communicate with current students about aspects such as student life and more detailed classroom experience.  Alice also noted that prospective students can connect with current Williams students using [Ask an Eph](https://admission.williams.edu/ask-an-eph/).


## Themes and Process

Our inquiries produced serveral key themes about user needs and design requirements.  We identified these themes through a progressive process of affinity diagramming.  We first created a diagram using notes taken from our inquiry with Vinny.  As we completed our other inquiries, we compared the notes taken from them to this initial diagram.  While each of these inquiries addressed a different user segment, the diagramming process yeilded significant overlap in their needs.  

First, users want a comfortable and casual environment in which they can discuss their interests and concerns.  To make this an effective and distinguished source of information for the college search process, we have to ensure that all users feel comfortable providing and asking for authentic representations of campus life.  Importantly, we need to emphasize through our design, that this is not a tool for admissions offices to assess candidates, but rather for applicants to learn about colleges from their students.

Second, this needs to be a trustworthy source.  For any stakeholder group--applicants, students, and admissions officials--to use this platform, it needs to provide trustworthy and honest information.  The current students who join need to be willing to share genuine information with applicants about their experiences, and applicants need to be willing to speak frankly about their own lives for the interactions to be useful.  Further, for admissions offices to embrace our platform, we will need to maintain a reputation as a source of valuable and truthful information for applicants--if we are simply steering applicants away from schools or supplying the same information as the admissions offices can, College Connect is not doing its job.

We note in particular that there is a theme of "shared interest".  On the prospective student's side, this means that the college should be able to host that interest for the student, and that a portion of the current students should share that interest.  For example, for Sam, this translates into the college having a great lacrosse team, and that there are current students who are also interested in lacrosse that he can talk to.  Moreover, this shared interest helps prospective and current students establish a relationship easier, so that important college information can be exchanged faster.  For college admissions, the prospective student demonstrating great interest in an activity that the college is interested in shows the student's dedication, and helps the student get admitted.  All of these factors will help each other.  For example, suppose A is interested in playing football, and connects with a large group of students at school S who are talented football players.  Then there is a high probability that school S values football players greatly, so communicating with current students will both help A get into a matching school and help S find the students it is looking for.

## Task Analysis
Provide brief answers to the following questions. These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.
Who is going to use the design?
Prospective and current college students.

What tasks do they now perform?
Prospective students either go to someone they already know for recommendations, or attend information sessions (campus tours) / visit college websites for general information. 

What tasks are desired?

Creating an account/profile

Personalization of account

Communication between high school and college students

Ranking of schools

Deciding whether they are considering a college

Personal messaging

Writing on forums

How are the tasks learned?
Through using the website and reading FAQs. If the design is good, this should be intuitive for the user.

Where are the tasks performed?
On a computer, generally in a dorm or house.

What is the relationship between the person and data?
We will store user information - their ranking of schools, profile - including who they have talked to and what was said so a user can see it later.

What other tools does the person have?
Their phone/computer to connect to school websites or friends who have information on colleges. 

How do people communicate with each other?
First they will connect through the website to exchange information then communicate via text, email, or phone.

How often are the tasks performed?
Ideally, tasks will be performed everyday as a user will keep in contact with high school or college students and constantly update their profile.

What are the time constraints on the tasks?
Should be completed instantly, especially with message communication.

What happens when things go wrong?
There is a miscommunication or page timeout. No real big issues should arise.
