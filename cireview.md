SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

## Participants

We  conducted three contextual inquiries with the key stakeholders in the college search process.  First, we observed a conversation between Vinny, a senior at Williams, and his cousin who is currently applying to Williams.  This inquiry importantly reminded us to pay attention to our college-aged users and ensure that we are serving the needs od this user segment.  Additionally, observing Vinny's conversation with his younger cousin made evident the importance of creating a platform that encourages casual and honest discourse between users.  

These user needs were further emphasized while observing Sam, a high school senior and potential lacrosse recruit from Vermont, at an admissions office information session.  During the session, Sam primarily expressed interest in the school's academics and resources.  However, when we discussed his college search process, Sam expressed that he valued information from other students more highly than from school administrators.  He said that, especially when speaking with potential teammates, he was able to get the "real feel" for the school and campus life.  He seemed particularly concerned with interpersonal relationships on campus, and relied on students he met to learn about how people in particular social groups interact and what they are involved in on campus.

## Themes and Process

Our inquiries produced serveral key themes about user needs and design requirements.  We identified these themes through a progressive process of affinity diagramming.  We first created a diagram using notes taken from our inquiry with Vinny.  As we completed our other inquiries, we compared the notes taken from them to this initial diagram.  While each of these inquiries addressed a different user segment, the diagramming process yeilded significant overlap in their needs.  

First, users want a comfortable and casual environment in which they can discuss their interests and concerns.  To make this an effective and distinguished source of information for the college search process, we have to ensure that all users feel comfortable providing and asking for authentic representations of campus life.  Importantly, we need to emphasize through our design, that this is not a tool for admissions offices to assess candidates, but rather for applicants to learn about colleges from their students.

Second, this needs to be a trustworthy source.  For any stakeholder group--applicants, students, and admissions officials--to use this platform, it needs to provide trustworthy and honest information.  The current students who join need to be willing to share genuine information with applicants about their experiences, and applicants need to be willing to speak frankly about their own lives for the interactions to be useful.  Further, for admissions offices to embrace our platform, we will need to maintain a reputation as a source of valuable and truthful information for applicants--if we are simply steering applicants away from schools or supplying the same information as the admissions offices can, College Connect is not doing its job.
