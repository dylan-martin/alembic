We chose to develop our connection-centered design because we feel that it will best serve our various user segments and will accomplish the tasks central to our platform's performance.  The use of a mobile platform with design references to other commonly used conversation-based apps will create a comfortable and familiar space for our users to interact with one another, a key requirement articulated during our contextual inquiry process.  Further, we chose to use a design that centers the interpersonal connection aspect of our platform because we feel that the ability to easily find other users and connect with them best fulfills the wants expressed by users in interviews and contextual inquiries.  Correspondingly, we chose to continue to develop our design to fulfill the user task "find others who have similar interests to you."  This task is central to our goal of providing useful and personal information to college applicants everywhere.  Additionally, we feel that this task provides significant opportunities to incorporate the principles of design that we have learned this semester.  We also chose to continue developing our design for the "college forums" task.  We believe that fulfilling the requirements of this task will push us to create a platform that provides useful information for the college search process to users.  This will also allow us to explore designs that present static information rather than facilitating personal discussions.



## Task 1:  Find other users with similar interests to you
