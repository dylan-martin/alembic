## Meeting Management
Our weekly meetings will be on Wednesdays, ?CHANGE?? to ?CHANGE?? pm.  Any group member can propose to add meeting times, and the group will vote to decide if the proposal passes.   Attendence is required for all members, unless special circumstances arise.  All group members are expected to arrive on time.  Everyone is expected to have a positive attitude, and should be excited for work.  During a meeting, anyone can re-adjust the task focus if we run off-track.  Decisions will be made by voting.  There will be no ties, since we have three members.  If two members have conflicting ideas, the third person will break the tie via voting.

## Accountability Process
All work should be fully documented.  We will be using GitHub as a sharing tool, and use either in-person or online communication.  All changes should be recorded either by informing the group, or recorded as commit descriptions on GitHub.  We will inform each other both before and after we make significant changes.

## Follow-up
We will revisit revisions of our contract every three weeks, or whenever a group member feels appropriate.  A team member can call attention to issues that arise that are not covered under the contract by direct communication, either via in-person discussion or online messages.  A revision will be made if more than half of the group agree.
