## Follow-up
We will revisit revisions of our contract every three weeks, or whenever a group member feels appropriate.  A team member can call attention to issues that arise that are not covered under the contract by direct communication, either via in-person discussion or online messages.  A revision will be made if more than half of the group agree.
