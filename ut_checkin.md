For a list of the issues identified in our original paper prototype through the heuristic evaluation process, please see our analysis of these results [here](/user_test.md).

## Updates from Heuristic Analysis

### Creating User Profile

* We added seperate personal profile creation pages for college applicants (right) and current college students (left).  The primary difference between these pages is in the "College"/"School List" entry areas.  The page for college students has a text-entry field where users can enter the college they attend.  The page for applicants replaces this with a drop-down entry field for the user's list of potential colleges, reflecting the different uses of the platform by these user segments.

* We made the text in the "Name," "College"/"School List," and "Class Year" fields write-over (e.g. the text "Name" will be replaced by the name the user enters) to make a more effective and reasonable layout for the page.

* We added "(optional)" text to several fields, as well as a brief description of the entry requirments for the "Interests" field to make the process of creating a personal profile easier for users to follow.  This addresses the "Help and Documentation" heuristic.

* We added a "back" button at the top left of the screen to allow users to back track if they select the incorrect user type in the previous screen.  This addresses the "Clearly Marked Exits" heuristic.

* We added a "done" button at the bottom left of the screen so that users can submit their information and be directed to the next section of the app.  This addresses the "Clearly Marked Exits" heuristic.

* We added a page, which users will be directed to after completing their personal profile and clicking the "done" button, which will guide users to the "Potential Connections" page.  This will remove ambiguity about how to navigate to the appropriate next section of the app.

## Usability Testing

We conducted three usability tests with our paper prototype.  All participants were current Williams college students and the tests were conducted in the common area of a Williams dorm.  We chose this location to replicate the settings in which current students would likely interact with our platform--because it is a mobile app deisgned to promote casual conversation, we expect users to engage with it in familiar and comfortable environments while there are distractions around them.  This environment choice was valuable in our testing, as it demonstrated which aspects of our interface demanded the most attention from users, and which aspects were most engaging to the participants.  While it may be hard to replicate this environment with applicant users (it may be difficulr

## Future Plans

After having conducted usability tests with college students, we now need to run usability tests with college applicants to get an understanding of how they will interact with our app. We will ask the user to make voice/video calls and have real-time conversations.
