## Creating User Profile

* We added seperate personal profile creation pages for college applicants (right) and current college students (left).  The primary difference between these pages is in the "College"/"School List" entry areas.  The page for college students has a text-entry field where users can enter the college they attend.  The page for applicants replaces this with a drop-down entry field for the user's list of potential colleges, reflecting the different uses of the platform by these user segments.

* We made the text in the "Name," "College"/"School List," and "Class Year" fields write-over (e.g. the text "Name" will be replaced by the name the user enters) to make a more effective and reasonable layout for the page.

* We added "(optional)" text to several fields, as well as a brief description of the entry requirments for the "Interests" field to make the process of creating a personal profile easier for users to follow.

* We added a "back" button at the top left of the screen to allow users to back track if they select the incorrect user type in the previous screen.

* We added a "done" button at the bottom left of the screen so that users can submit their information and be directed to the next section of the app.

* We added a page, which users will be directed to after completing their personal profile and clicking the "done" button, which will guide users to the "Potential Connections" page.  This will remove ambiguity about how to navigate to the appropriate next section of the app.
