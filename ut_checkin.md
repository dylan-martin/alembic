For a list of the issues identified in our original paper prototype through the heuristic evaluation process, please see our analysis of these results [here](/user_test.md).

## Updates from Heuristic Analysis

### Creating User Profile

* We added seperate personal profile creation pages for college applicants (right) and current college students (left).  The primary difference between these pages is in the "College"/"School List" entry areas.  The page for college students has a text-entry field where users can enter the college they attend.  The page for applicants replaces this with a drop-down entry field for the user's list of potential colleges, reflecting the different uses of the platform by these user segments.

* We made the text in the "Name," "College"/"School List," and "Class Year" fields write-over (e.g. the text "Name" will be replaced by the name the user enters) to make a more effective and reasonable layout for the page.

* We added "(optional)" text to several fields, as well as a brief description of the entry requirments for the "Interests" field to make the process of creating a personal profile easier for users to follow.  This addresses the "Help and Documentation" heuristic.

* We added a "back" button at the top left of the screen to allow users to back track if they select the incorrect user type in the previous screen.  This addresses the "Clearly Marked Exits" heuristic.

* We added a "done" button at the bottom left of the screen so that users can submit their information and be directed to the next section of the app.  This addresses the "Clearly Marked Exits" heuristic.

* We added a page, which users will be directed to after completing their personal profile and clicking the "done" button, which will guide users to the "Potential Connections" page.  This will remove ambiguity about how to navigate to the appropriate next section of the app.

## Start Conversations

* We added an option for audio calls, as seen on the upper-right corner.  This gives the user the option to only use audio call instead of video call, thus addressing the heuristic on privacy.

* Interface after pressing the audio call button. Waits for the other side to accept the request. The user can press “End Call” to end the call.

## Usability Testing

We conducted three usability tests with our paper prototype.  All participants were current Williams college students and the tests were conducted in the common area of a Williams dorm.  We chose this location to replicate the settings in which current students would likely interact with our platform--because it is a mobile app designed to promote casual conversation, we expect users to engage with it in familiar and comfortable environments while there are distractions around them.  This environment choice was valuable in our testing, as it demonstrated which aspects of our interface demanded the most attention from users, and which aspects were most engaging to the participants.  While it may be hard to replicate this environment with applicant users (it may be difficulr

## Results From Usability Tests

### Positive Incidents

* All users were able to complete the given tasks.

* Overall, they found the interface easy to use, especially the chat interface.

* Users liked being able to choose across text chat, audio call, and video call.

### Negative Incidents

* One user did not press the "Done" button after finishing filling out personal information.  Instead, he went directly to the potential connections tab.  We think this is a SEVERITY LEVEL HERE SEVERITY LEVEL HERE level incident.

* After clicking "continue" on the page that says "See your potential connections", two users were unaware that they were already on the potential connections page.  We think this is a SEVERITY LEVEL HERE SEVERITY LEVEL HERE level incident.

## Future Plans

After having conducted usability tests with college students, we now need to run usability tests with college applicants to get an understanding of how they will interact with our app. We will have a member of our team respond to the user's message and ask the user to make voice/video calls and have real-time conversations, so that they are less hesitant to make these actions than in cases without presence of message replies.

## Current Paper Prototype

### Start Conversations
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylan-martin/college_connect/master/wei_1.png" width="40%" height="40%"/>

* The user can press the “conversation” tab to navigate to the conversation interface. This interface shows the user’s conversations with other users, order by recent messages. The user can press the tab with the person’s name to begin chatting with that person. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylan-martin/college_connect/master/wei_chat_revise.png" width="40%" height="40%"/>

* This interface allows the user to chat with another user. At the top-left corner, the back arrow takes the user back to the previous page. The name of the person with whom the user is chatting is displayed at the top. At the top-right corner are options for audio call and video call.  Messages are shown in the main body of the interface, with the other person’s messages on the right. At the bottom, the user can enter a message and press “send” to send.
